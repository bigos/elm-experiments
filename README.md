# Elm Starter Projects

This is a small collection of basic apps written in Elm. They're intended to be
seeds for getting started with Elm, or exploring new concepts in the langauge.
They're all intentionally a bit incomplete or simple to encourage additions and
experimentation.

Each project has setup instructions, and some suggested next steps for adding
new features, although feel free to disregard the suggestions altogether if you
have creative ideas of your own!

## The Projects

### counter

Just a basic counter, with increment & decrement. This is a good place to start
if you're totally new to Elm. The suggested next steps are a good path from
adding to the basic Elm architecture to the beginnings of seeing how your code
will be different if you haven't worked in a primarly functional language
before.

### journal

This is a simple Journaling app. It has forms, (slightly broken) navigation, and
interacts with local storage via ports. Try this out once you have basic
familiarity with Elm if you're interested in building apps that work with
textual or static data.

### game

This isn't quite a game yet, but it could be. It uses subscriptions to listen to
keyboard events and animation frames. Try this one if you're interested in
building animated or highly interactive applications.
